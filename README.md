# Nocturnal Project

## Introduction

Nocturnal is a stylish and customizable portfolio site template built with GatsbyJS (React) and TailwindCSS. The project uses Github Actions to build the Gatsby site and deploy to Github Pages.

Please visit the [demo site](https://algebananazzzzz.github.io/NocturnalProject/) for a preview.

## Features 

1. **Main feature:** Provides a content abstraction level where all content is sourced from YAML files. Because of this, individuals can create fully personalized and functional portfolio site in less than 5 minutes without touching React code!

2. **CI/CD:** Using Github Actions, every commit will trigger an automation pipeline to build and deploy the site to Github Pages. No manual deployment steps are required. In other words, individuals can deploy their own live portfolio site everytime they push code!

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites in this project. However, if you want to develop or customize your portfolio further, you'll need to download `GatsbyJS` to preview your portfolio locally.

1. Install Gatsby on your local machine using this [instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/part-0/).

2. After cloning the repository, within the directory, download required npm packages using this command.

```shell
npm install
```

3. Preview the deployment site with this command.

```shell
gatsby develop
```

## Installation 

1. To clone the repository, use this command.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/algebananazzzzz/NocturnalProject.git
```

2. Create a new repository in your GitHub account.

3. Remove the existing git origin.

```shell
git remote rm origin
```

4. Add the new repository as the new git origin.
```shell
git add remote origin ssh://github.com/<your_new_repo>.git
```

## Deployment

> Minimal steps are required as deployment is taken care by Github Actions!

1. Modify pathPrefix (optional):

If your GitHub Pages repository is not served from the root domain (for example, itâ€™s at https://username.github.io/repo-name), set the pathPrefix in `gatsby-config.ts` to "/repo-name". This ensures that your portfolio loads correctly from the repository subpath.

```ts
const config: GatsbyConfig = {
  // Change this according to your repository name
  pathPrefix: `/NocturnalProject`,
  ...
}
```

2. Add and commit your changes

```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
```

3. Set checkout branch to main

```shell
git checkout -b main
```

4. Push to remote origin

```shell
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your_new_repo>.git
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

## Customizing Your Portfolio Content

> Edit the YAML files to update your portfolio contentâ€”no code changes are needed!

Your portfolio content is managed through YAML files under `src/content/`. Each file represents a section of your site, such as **About**, **Projects**, **Skills**, and **Experiences**. You can edit these files to personalize your portfolio.

### General Guidelines

1. **SVG Icons**: Place SVGs in `src/assets/svg` and reference by name in YAML.  
2. **Static Assets**: Place PDFs, images, or videos in `static/`. Reference them with `asset: "filename.ext"` or `video: filename.mp4` for video previews.
3. **Adding Sections**: You can create new sections by following the same YAML structure provided in the files.  
4. **Text Styling**: Use arrays for multiple paragraphs; they are rendered with proper spacing automatically.


### 1. Navbar Section (`navbar.yml`)
```yaml
title: "My Portfolio"

contact_buttons:
